# What is Clicky?
**Clicky is yet another compact and easy to use Auto Clicker for Windows.**

## Why another one?
The current options did not really compell to me, so I made my own!\
I needed an Auto Clicker, which just listens for a hotkey and executes mouse clicks at a given rate, when holding down the key.

## Installation
**--Clicky currently only works for Windows--**\
You can download the latest release [here.](https://github.com/Lennywinks/Clicky/releases/download/latest/Clicky.exe)

**Windows might not trust this file. When opening Clicky.exe a blue window might pop up.**\
In this case you have to press **More Info** and then **Run Anyways**

## Configuration - How to Use
![Clicky Screenshot](https://github.com/Lennywinks/Clicky/blob/main/img/clicky_screenshot.png?raw=True)
1. Choose the Mouse Button to be used
2. Choose the Clicks per Second via the slider. Minimum is 1 and Maximum is 100 Clicks per Second. [(Actual values might differ.)](#known-issues)
3. Choose a Mode:\
   **Hold Down** waits for your Hotkey and clicks as long as you keep holding it down. Release it to stop clicking.\
   **Press Once** waits for you Hotkey. Once you press it, it starts clicking. Press it again to stop clicking.
4. Press **Change Hotkey** and enter a new key combination.
5. Press **Start**. Clicky will start waiting for your Hotkey. No changes to settings can be made, while it is running.
6. Press **Stop** to stop listening to your inputs or make changes to the settings.
   
## Known Issues
- The Clicks per Second (CPS) rate differs based on the CPU you are using. You might have to test the actual CPS value and adjust accordingly.
